**My Portfolio Website**

Welcome to my portfolio website hosted on GitHub! I've designed this site to showcase my journey as a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science & Engineering. It's built entirely with HTML for structure, inline CSS for styling, and a touch of JavaScript for a bit of interactivity.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript
